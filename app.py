st.write("""The used car market is a dynamic landscape where various factors such as the car's model, age, condition, and mileage significantly influence the vehicle's resale value. Understanding the interplay between these variables can provide insights into pricing trends and customer preferences. 

In this project, we will analyze a dataset of used cars to identify pricing patterns based on car models, model years, and other key attributes. Specifically, we aim to explore how car prices vary across different models and how factors like the odometer reading (mileage) and the year of production impact the final price. Additionally, we will remove any data outliers to ensure a more accurate representation of pricing trends.

By visualizing these relationships and filtering outliers, the project will deliver more informative and actionable insights into the pricing behaviors in the used car market, helping both consumers and sellers make informed decisions.""")

We will start by cleaning the dataset to handle missing values and split columns where necessary. Hereâ€™s what we will do:

1. **Handle Missing Values**: We'll fill missing values for the `model_year`, `cylinders`, and `odometer` columns by grouping by car model and using the median value for imputation.
2. **Split Columns**: We will split the `model` column into separate `make` and `model` columns for easier analysis.
3. **Convert Data Types**: Ensure that the `model_year` and other relevant columns have appropriate data types, converting to integers where applicable.
4. **Remove Outliers**: Filter out the extreme values in `price` and `model_year` to ensure the analysis remains focused on relevant data points.""")

st.header('Overall Conclusion')
st.write("""

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) provided valuable insights into the dataset of used vehicles in the U.S. market.

1. **Price Distribution**:
   The distribution of vehicle prices showed that the majority of vehicles fall within a lower price range, with a few outliers priced significantly higher. This suggests that most of the listed vehicles are affordable options, while luxury models or newer vehicles might be driving up the upper range of prices.

2. **Odometer vs Price**: paraphrase this for app.py 
   There is a clear inverse relationship between the odometer reading and the price. Vehicles with lower mileage tend to be priced higher, as expected, since mileage is often a key indicator of vehicle condition and wear. High-mileage cars are priced lower, likely due to the expectation of greater future maintenance needs.

3. **Model Year vs Price**:
   Newer model years generally command higher prices, reflecting the vehicle's newer condition and up-to-date technology. Older models see a gradual depreciation in value, although certain models retain more value than others.

4. **Condition of Vehicles**:
   Most vehicles in the dataset are listed in "good" or "excellent" condition, which reflects seller attempts to market their vehicles positively. Vehicles in "fair" or "poor" condition are priced lower, as expected, due to higher expected repair costs.

5. **Odometer Readings**:
   Most vehicles in the dataset had odometer readings between 50,000 and 150,000 miles, aligning with typical used vehicle listings. Very low or very high mileage vehicles were less common, and these extremes had notable impacts on price.

6. **Impact of Preprocessing**:
   By filling in missing values and removing outliers, the dataset became more reliable for analysis. This step ensured that any skewed data points didn't distort conclusions drawn from visualizations, particularly in terms of price vs model year and odometer readings.

In conclusion, the dataset shows typical patterns expected in a used car market, where price is driven primarily by vehicle age, condition, and mileage.""")
